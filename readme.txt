Initial Release.

- Disabled various Anti-Debug features;
- Applied 64 bit compilations flag (>2 Gigs ram usage/DEP);
- Improved DirectX Usage/Miltithreading Support;
- Restored Game.INI (Global config file for the gameengine);
[Including various setting such fps limit, shadows size, resolution, fullscreen/windowed mode switch]

PS. No you don't have to rename the exe file to use it but if you want to use the original one you have to rename or remove game.ini.
Set these settings wisely. If you can't run the game - use the default settings.
