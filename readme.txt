Initial Release + Update 1 [27 September 2020].
================================================================================================================================================================
- Disabled various Anti-Debug features;
- Applied 64 bit compilation flags (>2 Gigs ram usage/DEP/Terminal Server Aware);
- Improved DirectX Usage/Multithreading Support;
- Restored the 'Game.INI' (A global config file for the game engine);
[Including various settings such as fps limit, shadows size, resolution, fullscreen/windowed mode switch etc].
================================================================================================================================================================
PS. My currently patched executable is now using its own config file (conf.ini) with the same purpose so it doesn't conflict with unpatched 'Alone.exe' anymore.
Don't rename both exe and config files please. Set all settings wisely. If you can't run the game - use the default settings.
